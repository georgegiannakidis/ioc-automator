# IoC Automator

This project processes **file** and **IP** Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and provides safe automation for:

- Detecting malicious files (filename + hash)
- Preparing IP blocklists for firewall rules
- Running in dry-run mode for safe testing
- Logging everything for investigation

This is a learning and demonstration project for security automation.
